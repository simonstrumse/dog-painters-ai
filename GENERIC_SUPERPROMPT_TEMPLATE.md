## üéØ Real Example: Dog Painters AI

**Original Superprompt:**
```
You are an expert AI engineer. Build a production-ready web app that allows users to upload one or several images of their dog and transform them into AI-generated portraits in famous artist styles using the OpenAI Images API.

The app must integrate the following complete "Dog Art Style Library." Each artist has multiple sub-styles, which should be available for user selection. The backend must map user selections into prompts for the OpenAI Images API.

[Complete 20+ artist library with 80+ sub-styles provided...]

Core App Requirements:
- Users upload one or multiple images of their dog
- Choose one or multiple artist sub-styles from the library above  
- Backend translates style choice ‚Üí correct OpenAI prompt
- Generate and return transformed portraits via OpenAI Images API
- Provide progress/loading UI (since generations may take ~1 min)
- Side-by-side comparisons with original + styled results
- Download in HD
- Mobile responsive, clean UI

Tech Stack:
- Frontend: React + Tailwind + shadcn/ui
- Backend: Next.js API routes
- Storage: Firebase Storage for images
- Auth: Firebase email/social login
- Deployment: Vercel

Deliverable: production-ready app + modular style library for expansion.
